# shetech

A clean, responsive front-end website built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. shetech is a static site / landing-portfolio template focused on accessibility, responsive layout, and simple interactive UI elements (animations, navigation, and contact/gallery components). It’s intended as a lightweight starting point for personal portfolios, small projects, or informational sites.

Demo

Key features
- Responsive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Semantic HTML structure and accessible markup
- Modern CSS (flexbox/grid) and modular stylesheet organization
- Lightweight vanilla JavaScript for UI interactions (menu toggles, smooth scroll, simple form handling)
- Visual polish: transitions, hover states, and basic animations
- Static, no build step required — easy to fork and customize

Tech stack / Languages
- HTML (~52% of repo)
- CSS (~33.9% of repo)
- JavaScript (~14.1% of repo)
- (Optional: list any libraries used — e.g., Font Awesome, Google Fonts — add them if present)

Getting started

Requirements
- A modern web browser
- (Optional) A static server for local testing such as VS Code Live Server, http-server (npm), or Python’s simple HTTP server

Run locally (quick)
- Option A — open locally:
  1. Clone the repository:
     git clone https://github.com/lionellite/shetech.git
  2. Open the site by double-clicking index.html or opening it in your browser.

- Option B — run a local static server (recommended for correct routing and CORS)
  - Using VS Code Live Server: open the repository and click "Live Server".
  - Using Python 3:
    cd shetech
    python -m http.server 8000
    Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.
  - Using npm http-server:
    npm install -g http-server
    http-server .
    Open the URL printed in the terminal.

Project structure (example — update to match repository)
- index.html — main landing/home page
- about.html — about / bio page (if present)
- contact.html — contact form page (if present)
- assets/
  - css/ — stylesheets (main.css, components, variables)
  - js/ — JavaScript files (main.js, helpers)
  - img/ — images and screenshots
- README.md — this file
- LICENSE — project license (if added)

Customizing
- Brand & content: update HTML pages with your copy, images, and social links.
- Styles: edit CSS files in assets/css/ or main stylesheet to change colors, spacing, typography.
- Scripts: modify assets/js/main.js for behavior changes (navigation, animations, form validation).
- Add pages: copy index.html and modify content, update navigation links accordingly.

Accessibility & performance notes
- Use semantic tags (header, nav, main, footer) for better structure and screen reader support.
- Use alt attributes for images and aria attributes where needed for interactive controls.
- Keep images optimized (WebP/optimized JPEG/PNG) and use responsive srcset where appropriate.
- Minify CSS/JS and compress assets for production deployment if desired.

Testing
- Verify responsiveness by resizing the browser or using device mode in dev tools.
- Test keyboard navigation and screen reader basics.
- If a contact form exists and posts to a server, verify backend endpoint or service (e.g., Formspree, Netlify Forms).
